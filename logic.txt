ARP SPOOFING/ARP POISONING ATTACK Detection & Mitigation


build the ARP data structure 
  mac_to_ip[dpid][mac_address] = ipaddress

1. look the ARP Request & ARP Reply  and build the data structure
    mac_to_ip[dpid][a.src_mac] = ip

2. When the ARP Packet gets in, check the src mac against the Table
   if mac is not present in the table 
   -   its a new entry, add with ip and mac
   if mac is present in the table,
     check the src ip, in port against the stored one,
     if it is different ,  ITS A ARP ATTACK, Declare it as ATTACK.

-  Mitigation : Block the Port
